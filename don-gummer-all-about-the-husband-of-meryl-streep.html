Streep and Cazale were in a serious relationship and had an apartment in Tribeca, from which she was ultimately booted out when Cazale died.</p><p>Gummer, who knew Streep’s brother Harry, went to assist her and subsequently became her soul healer. When Gummer was going outside of the nation, they communicated through letters. Streep was first hesitant to begin a new relationship, but she ended up remaining with Gummer once he returned from his trip.&nbsp;Six months later, on September 30, 1978, they exchanged wedding vows on the grounds of Streep’s parents’ house. They have been married for more than four decades and are still going strong. They are the epitome of ideal soulmates.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Don-Gummer-1.jpg alt="Don Gummer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Father of four grown-up, self-sufficient children</h2><p>Gummer is the father of four grown-up, self-sufficient children who he shares with his wife of over four decades. Gummer, according to Streep, was a very engaged father who was more easygoing when it comes to parenting his children, while Streep was more of a tiger mom. She also mentioned that she did not feel bad about taking many months off from work since her spouse did not make her feel that way.</p><p>Parenting their four children and guiding them toward independence required collaboration. All of their children are involved in the entertainment industry. Their lone son, Henry Wolfe, is a musician and the family’s firstborn. He was born in the year 1979. Among their three daughters, Mamie, born in 1983, and Grace, born in 1986, are both actors, while their youngest daughter Louisa, born in 1991, is a model.&nbsp;The lovely family of six lived in Connecticut till their four children went away. After all four of their children had gone away, the couple relocated to New York.</p><h2>His wife considers herself fortunate to have him as a spouse.</h2><p>Gummer has remained at his beloved wife Streep’s side from the day they swore to be by one other’s sides. In an interview, Streep stated that she was fortunate to have married a wonderful partner many years ago. She also mentioned meeting the ideal guy, who never felt overshadowed by his celebrity companion since he was secure in his own personality.</p><p>Streep recently said that she let her spouse read her screenplay and only did it if he loved it. In 2012, when winning one of her Academy Awards, she gave a speech in which she conveyed her thanks. She thanked her husband first, claiming that thanking him at the conclusion of the speech would take him out of the song. She also wanted him to know that he had given her what she valued most in their life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Don-Gummer-2.jpg alt="Don Gummer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What did his daughters have to say about him?</h2><p>His daughter Grace described him as a lovely, loving, supportive father and an incredible artist in an interview. She also said that she enjoys traveling to museums and sharing things with him.&nbsp;Similarly, his daughter Mamie said to Peter Travers in Popcorn with Peter Travers that the best part about her father was his honesty. He can never lie, according to her, even if they occasionally desire him to.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Gummer’s creative work has been recognized for decades. His work on a tabletop and wall-mounted sculptures, as well as free-standing sculptures, is remarkable. He has a net worth of $150 million as of August 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibqKZdnMKuucSrZJqknGKuo7vUrWStoJVitba%2FwZqlnWWfm3qusdGyo2arpKeypryO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mary-kate-connor-bio-family-boyfriend-height-the-voice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Get To Know Mary Kate Connor!
