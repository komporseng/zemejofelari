As the team’s scoring leader again in her sophomore season, Kelley contributed to their advancement to the NCAA tournament’s third round. In her junior year, O’Hara assisted her university in being eligible for the College Cup for the first time since 1993.

For the Stanford Cardinal, Kelley finished her collegiate career with 57 goals and 32 assists, both of which were school records at the time.</p><p>O’Hara won the 2009 Hermann Trophy as the best college soccer player. She scored 4 goals while playing for the USL W-League team Pali Blues in the summer of 2009, just before she graduated from college.</p><h2>O’Hara, Kelley | Club Career</h2><p>Kelley was selected by FC Gold Pride with the third overall pick in the 2010 WPS Draft. When Albertin Montoya was their head coach at Stanford University in 2009, she had previously played with him.</p><p>The team dominated, finishing first in the standings at the end of the regular season, and advanced directly to the championship playoff game. They also defeated the Philadelphia Independence by a score of four goals to zero to win the WPS Championship.</p><p>Despite all of their achievements, the club was forced to close in November 2010 due to their inability to meet the league’s financial reserve criteria.</p><p>O’Hara spent her next two seasons in the WPS earning 10 goals before being signed by the Boston Breakers as an outside midfielder. The league disbanded before the 2012 season could start, so she signed with the Atlanta Beat but was unable to play there.</p><p>O’Hara reverted to playing as a forward on January 11, 2013, when she signed with Sky Blue FC in the brand-new National Women’s Soccer League.</p><p>Kelley played in a variety of positions for the team when she was there, including attacker, winger, right-back, and center defender.</p><p>Due to a hamstring injury, Kelley was only able to play in 8 games for the team in 2018 after being moved to the Utah Royals on December 29, 2017.</p><h2>Career International Kelley O’Hara</h2><p>O’Hara was a member of multiple American youth national teams from 2005 through 2010. She scored 24 goals in her 35 under-20 games. In the women’s football competition at the 2007 Pan American Games, Kelley scored four goals while re-joining the U-20 national squad. Unfortunately, the U-20-only squad fell to Brazil in the championship game.</p><p>Additionally, O’Hara made her final appearance for the U-20 team at the 2008 CONCACAF Women’s U-20 Championship in Puebla, Mexico, while Kelley participated in the U-20 Four Nations Tournament that was contested in Chile in February 2008.</p><p>Her services helped the squad earn a spot in the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in Chile. She participated in the NCAA postseason with her collegiate team, not the tournament, which is a shame.</p><h3>Team Senior National</h3><p>O’Hara attended the training camp in January 2010 after being called up by the senior national team’s training camp in December 2009. She then won her maiden national team cap in a friendly match against Mexico in March 2010.</p><h3>FIFA Women’s World Cup of 2011</h3><p>The first World Cup roster of 21 players did not include O’Hara. But Lindsay Tarpley’s ACL tear against Japan forced her to be replaced, and she only got to play once, against Sweden, in a group stage game. In the competition, the US team took home the silver medal.</p><h3>Olympics in 2012</h3><p>O’Hara was deployed in other positions in 2012 after Ali Krieger suffered an ACL injury at the CONCACAF Women’s Olympic Qualifying Tournament, despite the fact that she had always been an offensive threat.</p><p>In her maiden game as a left-back, O’Hara contributed to three goals. The match versus Guatemala took place on January 22, 2012, as part of the Olympic Qualifications. After that, she made her right-back debut against Costa Rica.</p><p>One of three players on her team—the other two being goalie Hope Solo and captain Christie Rampone—Kelley played the whole 570 minutes for the United States team during the 2012 Olympic Games.</p><h3>the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2015 and 2019</h3><p>O’Hara began the tournament against China PR in the quarterfinal after missing the first four games for her United States team. Then, in the semifinal match against Germany, she scored the first goal of her international career to help her team win 2-0.</p><p>The United States then defeated Japan 5-2 to win the tournament, their first since the inaugural FIFA Women’s World Cup in 1991, and their third overall. Along with Megan Rapinoe and Emily Sonnett, O’Hara was one of fifty athletes who sued the USWNT in 2016, claiming salary discrimination and gender inequality.</p><p>O’Hara was subsequently chosen for the 2019 FIFA World Cup in France, despite the fact that her injuries prevented her from seeing much action. She participated in every game of the knockout stage, and the US team defeated the Netherlands 2-0 in that game.</p><h3>Relationships and Coming Out as a Lesbian in 2019: Kelley O’Hara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2021-02-17-at-6.33.50.jpg><p>After the World Cup 2019, a fresh photo of Kelley O’Hara that she had been dating since they were kids appeared online. She had previously been seeing Adam Sweat. O’Hara came out as a lesbian when she was photographed kissing Kameryn Stanhouse after her team won the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup.</p><p>O’Hara doesn’t talk much about her personal life in the public, although it is true that she spends her offseasons in Washington, DC, with her girlfriend.</p><h3>Defends Flag</h3><p>Additionally, she gained popularity on the internet in 2019 and not simply because she repeated as World Cup champion. When the athlete noticed the American flag on the ground, he moved quickly to save it.</p><p>She then became famous online for scooping up the flag that Allie Long had dropped while reveling in Megan Rapinoe’s victory over the Golden Boot.</p><h3>Tokyo Olympics in 2020</h3><p>The athlete is competing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in hopes of winning another gold medal. O’Hara will make her third Olympic debut in Tokyo in 2020. At the Summer Olympics in 2012 and 2016, she played for the United States women’s national soccer team (USWNT). Despite winning in 2012, the USWNT did not medal at the 2016 Olympics.</p><p>Additionally, they lost to Sweden in the quarterfinals and came in fifth overall. As a result, the women’s team is under a lot of pressure to win gold, which they have consistently done since 1996 with the exception of 2000 and 2016.</p><p>In addition, the USWNT has won the most gold medals in both the men’s and women’s competitions in the Olympic Soccer Tournament than any other nation. It follows that their nation has high hopes for them in order to keep the number of gold medals rising. O’Hara is defending for the national team.</p><p>In addition, the USWNT already crushed New Zealand 6-1 in their opening Olympic match in Tokyo. However, the supporters are very hopeful for the women’s squad and are upbeat about their ability to win a sixth gold medal. On July 27, 2021, the US will play Australia.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE :&nbsp;<a href=# rel=bookmark>Maggie Nichols</a></p><h2>The social media presence of Kelley O’Hara</h2><p>On her social media, O’Hara is very active.
