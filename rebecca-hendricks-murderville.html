Actress Nicole Sullivan is cast as Rebecca on Murderville Netflix. Some fans misspell the character's name as Rebecca Hendrix.</strong></p><p>Terry Seattle, a murder investigator played by <strong>Will Arnett</strong>, is the protagonist of<strong> <a href=#>Murderville</a></strong>. Murderville is an improvised criminal comedy in which some of the cast members are written and the special guest improves over the program. The visitor must next determine who the assailant is.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> released the show on February 3, 2022. The series is based on the BBC3 serial Murder in Successville. Arnett (<a href=# rel=noopener>@arnettwill</a>) is joined by<strong> Haneefah Wood</strong> as Chief Rhonda Jenkins-Seattle, <strong>Lilan Bowden</strong> as medical examiner Amber Kang, and <strong>Phillip Smithey</strong> as Det. Darren "Daz" Phillips.</p><p><strong>Conan O'Brien</strong>, <strong>Annie Murphy</strong>, <strong>Ken Jeong</strong>, <strong>Kumail Nanjiani</strong>,<strong> Marshawn Lynch</strong>,<strong> Sharon Stone</strong>, and<strong> Erinn Hayes</strong> are among the special guests.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <strong><a href=#>Deb</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Tommy Tune</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href=#>triplets</a></strong>.</p><h2>Who is Rebecca Hendricks in Murderville?</h2><p>After <strong><a href=#>Lori Griffin</a></strong>'s murder investigation gets re-opened, Terry, Ken, and Rhonda return to the scene of the crime. They discover a professional-grade hunting knife as the murder weapon, as well as a shattered lens, a<strong> James Taylor</strong> concert ticket, a four-leaf clover pin, and a mystery card with three parts cut off, from the evidence already gathered.</p><p>Terry inserts the card into Lori's notepad, which emphasizes the three suspects' names. The first suspect is Seamus Doyle, a former enforcer for the Irish mafia who is currently incarcerated.</p><p>Rebecca Hendricks is the second suspect. She was the project manager for the new Monterey Towers condo project. However, she is now well-known as a star of the investing show Den of Snakes.</p><p>Terry and Ken <a href=# rel=noopener>take on the role</a> of undercover cops. They dress up as Ice Breakerz contestants. Rebecca Hendricks admits her maiden name is O'Leary while on the show. Rebecca, although claiming to assist others, fails to recognize the potential in Ice Breakerz and rejects their offer. And the final suspect is Donald Barton, aka the commissioner.</p><p>All suspects are led to the Monterey Towers when the inquiry is completed. Once there, Ken says that he believes Donald is the murderer. He reveals to Rhonda that Donald has broken spectacles, a planner with 2006 missing, and a hunter's license. However, Rebecca Hendricks is the murderer.</p><p>According to Rhonda, Rebecca wears spectacles, has Irish ancestry, and owns hunting gear businesses. It couldn't have been Barton because he only wore reading glasses and wouldn't attend a James Taylor performance because he can't handle huge crowds. Seamus, on the other hand, utilizes a sniper rifle, which necessitates exceptional eyesight.</p><p>Rebecca explains that Lori was killed because she was obstructing the development of the Monterey Towers. However, Terry soon discovers that Rebecca recruited Seamus' help in frightening an entire community into moving and that she paid Barton off so that the cops would turn a blind eye. So all three suspects were arrested.</p><h2>Murderville: Actress Nicole Sullivan Plays Rebecca Hendricks in the Netflix Show</h2><p><strong>Nicole Sullivan </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>sullivannicole</a>) is an actress and comedian from the United States who is best known for her six seasons on the sketch comedy show<a href=# rel=noopener> MADtv</a> (1995–2001).
