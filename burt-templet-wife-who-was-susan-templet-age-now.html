She recently appeared on Netflix’s I Just Killed My Dad to shed some light on the relationship dynamics between her and her late husband Burt. So, where is she now? How old is she?</p><p>You’ve come to the right place as this article covers it all.</p><h3><strong>Meet Burt Templet Wife, Susan Templet</strong></h3><p>In 2008, a mutual friend of Susan Templet and Burt Templet introduced them to each other in a sports bar in Louisiana. Anthony was very young at the time when his parents started dating each other. Susan raised Anthony as her own once the couple began living together. He struck her as amusing and careless.</p><p>But, over time, Anthony began changing, and Susan mentioned on the show how difficult it was to interpret what he was feeling because he seldom expressed any emotion.</p><p>Susan didn’t know that her husband had taken Anthony by force from Teresa Thompson when he was about five years old. He was reared at Burt’s “hell house” by his stepmother Susan Templet, who took it upon herself to educate Anthony. After Burt forbade Anthony from attending school, she taught him his name, date of birth, address, and phone number, as well as his “ABCs.”</p><p>She said, however, that Burt had requested her not to educate him because he could use a calculator instead.</p><p>Susan said, “Anthony is my child. I don’t see him as a stepson. I see him as my child because I know he has nobody. He has nobody to stand behind him.”</p><p>In the show, Susan addressed the abuse saying, “The physical abuse would’ve been weekly, and the verbal abuse every other day.” She asserted that Burt requested that she not instruct him since he could use a calculator in its place. Susan added, “Burt had an app on his phone – with every movement on a camera, he’d get a text of what was going on. Every time I turned my car engine off, he’d get an alert that it was off.”</p><p>Along with time, Burt’s abusive behavior started to surface. As reported, Susan eventually left Burt in early 2019. Susan had filed for a protective order against him.</p><p>The situation reached a breaking point in March 2019 when Susan departed after a physical altercation with Burt. Susan later described the extent of the abuse she experienced in a protective order that she filed. She claims that Burt hit her in the head and threw objects to the ground during an altercation in January 2019. Susan claimed he hit her a month earlier, breaking one of her teeth.</p><p class="text | article-text">In a 55-page protective order filed in Livingston Parish by Susan, she claims Burt abused her physically multiple times. According to the protective order, on Jan. 20, Burt and Susan began arguing when he smashed a radio and portable heater on the ground. It states that he then punched her in the head. The documents she filed state when she tried to clean the blood from her face, Burt started splashing water on her face, verbally abused her again, then allegedly threatened to “cut her into little pieces”.</p><p>After the incident in March 2019, Susan fled right away, but she was unable to take Anthony with her. She did that because she thought Burt would have pursued her.</p><h3><strong>How Long Were Burt And Susan Templet Married?</strong></h3><p>There is no information on Burt and Susan Templet’s marriage. But, they were likely married for more than 8 years. Before Burt, Susan was married to her ex-husband Dennis Mannino. Two of them had a son named Peyton Mannino. After the divorce, Peyton started living with Susan, Burt, and Anthony.</p><p>Peyton discussed how his stepbrother frequently spent most of his time in his room behind locked doors. He believed such was the case because Anthony was unable to be himself with his father since he was both too afraid and uneasy enough. On the show, he talked about how his stepbrother frequently spent most of his time imprisoned inside his room.</p><p>Anthony was unable to be himself around his father because he was both too terrified and uncomfortable, which led Peyton to believe that this was the situation.</p><p>As of 2022, her Facebook that she is still widowed.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Susan Templet Now?</strong></h3><p>In 2021, Anthony Templet was released on supervised probation and lived with his stepmother Susan Templet. Susan did not support a prison term for him. Living in Zachary, Louisiana, Susan appears to be doing a lot better right now. She seems to enjoy being with her family and assisting Anthony in moving on with his life.</p><p>Susan and Anthony’s mother Teresa also seem to be bonding with each other. Teresa can be seen commenting and complimenting on Susan’s Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Susan Templet Age</strong></h3><p>Born in May 1966, Susan Templet is 56 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Susan Templet Job</strong></h3><p>Susan Templet is yet to open up about her job.</p><h3><strong>Is Susan Templet On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, Susan Templet is not on Instagram.
