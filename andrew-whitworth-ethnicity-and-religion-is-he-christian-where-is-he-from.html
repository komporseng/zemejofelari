He was also born on December 12, 1981, in Monroe, Louisiana, to Charlotte Whitworth and James Whitworth. Don Shows coached the Rebels at West Monroe High School, where the Louisiana native played high school football.&nbsp;He was also a Louisiana tennis champion and an excellent golfer.</p><p>When Whitworth graduated from high school, CNNSI.com ranked him as the nation’s sixth-best offensive line prospect, and he committed to play football at LSU.&nbsp;After college, he started his professional career as the Cincinnati Bengals’ 55th overall choice in the 2006 NFL draft.&nbsp;Later, the LVI Super Bowl champion joined the Los Angeles Rams in 2017 and has been with the team ever since.&nbsp;Throughout his professional career, he has been selected First-Team All-Pro (2015 and 2017), Pro Bowl (2012, 2015-17), and Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year (2021).</p><h2>Andrew Whitworth’s Ethnicity and Religion</h2><p>Andrew, an American citizen, was born in Louisiana and is said to be of white ethnicity. Whitworth said that he adopted Christianity at an early age, although he largely concentrated on self-interest and continues to practice the Christian faith.&nbsp;The former professional football tackle feels that his ethnic and religious heritage gives him pride and reflects his standing as an athlete representing the United States. Nonetheless, he had countless ups and downs in his personal life while pursuing his professional goals.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Andrew-Whitworth-1.jpg alt="Andrew Whitworth" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to James Whitworth, “I had lots of success as an athlete, but my personal life was a wreck.”&nbsp;He went on to say, “I was disloyal to women, my family, and most significantly, to God. I thought I was tough and had it all together, but I was simply kidding myself.”&nbsp;Following his second season in the NFL, Whitworth attended church and rekindled his religion.&nbsp;Furthermore, he claimed, “I knelt and acknowledged my fatigue from running. Ready to accept His call, I now live with clarity, a complete heart, and a desire to share Christ’s love.”</p><h2>Andrew and Joe Controversy: Trolling His Wife</h2><p><strong>Melissa, Andrew Whitworth’s wife</strong>, sent a tweet imploring Rams supporters not to sell their NFC tickets to other teams.&nbsp;She added, “If any Rams NFL fans want to sell their tickets, I’ll purchase them. Please do not sell them to the other team!”&nbsp;Mrs. Melissa tweeted this in response to Rams supporters’ fears about 49ers fans flooding SoFi Stadium. However, Joe Staley of the NFL mocked her, saying, “If you RamsNFL fans want to sell your tickets, I’ll buy them.” Please do not sell them to your team.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Andrew-Whitworth-2.jpg alt="Andrew Whitworth" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Andrew was outraged when Joe and 49ers fans collectively harassed his wife for over a week.&nbsp;Regarding the situation, he wrote a message denouncing the men’s lack of manners and said that the 49ers may come, but he would leave proudly.&nbsp;Furthermore, he emerged triumphant from the game. Later, Melissa and Andrew thanked Joe and the 49ers for witnessing Andrew’s victory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYp5yimsRuw8eiq7Cnoqm1brHToaWim5mpxm6tzZ1kq52cnrSqu81moKxlmJp6pLTRoqqtoZGjeri0xKucZqGjYrWmecWrpqZn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anna-anka.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Anka">&larr;
