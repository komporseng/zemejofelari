I then got out of prison in 1969,” Trejo explained, sharing that he didn’t realize he’d ignored his underlying substance abuse issue before entering the program.</p><p>“I didn’t think turning me on to marijuana was abuse when I was 8. I thought it was sharing. It was a form of abuse. I didn’t know,” the actor shared. “So when you finally start realizing, ‘Wait a minute man, this is not right,’ that’s when the healing really begins.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo in the 1996 action/horror film “From Dusk Till Dawn.” <span class=credit>X/officialDannyT</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo as the bartender at Rocky’s bar, grill, and fine dining for the 2004 film “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.” <span class=credit>CBS via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following his release in August 1969, the actor kept his promise to himself and God and stayed clean, ushering in over five decades of a flourishing acting career.</p><p>Since landing his first acting role in 1985’s “Runaway Train,” Trejo has 420 acting credits under his belt, according to the star’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>.</p><p>“I wake up every morning and say, ‘Dear heavenly Father, please let me help whoever I can for my fellow man. And I’ll say your name every day, and I’ll do whatever I can,’” Trejo shared.</p><p>His strong faith and guidance from God have not subsided in the years since his release, with the actor still keeping a dialogue with the higher power.</p><p>“He lived up to his deal. I’m living up to mine,” he told the outlet. “I even asked God a couple of days ago, ‘How am I doing?’ He said, ‘Trejo, you’re doing great. Keep it up. You’re almost out of hell.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21fma6vuthmq6udmqR6pLHLnpmrmaSawG6BlGawnpmiqHqwsoysppuqmZrBunnOn52eqqNixLC%2Bw6xkqJ5drLa0sM6mZJ%2BnomKur8XOp5xmq6Snwqizy6KloGWppMJur8CnZK2nn2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./didier-drogba-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Didier Drogba Net Worth  Houses &amp;amp; Cars">&larr;
